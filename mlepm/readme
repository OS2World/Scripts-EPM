/* readme  - this is the readme file of the MLEPM package    950919 */

MLEPM adds hooks, highlighting and various editing mode to EPM, in a way
that makes it easy for users to incorporate into their own EPM setup.  It
is a customized version of EPM that users who don't want to recompile the
macros can use directly.

Enjoy!

Release notes
=============

      o  This package is in beta, so, please, be indulgent :), and send
         me all your comments at the following address:

            lafaix@alto.unice.fr

      o  This release of MLEPM has been tested with EPM v5.51 and 6.00c
         only.  If you use another version, you may have to recompile
         the macros with the corresponding ETPM.  Doing so should enable
         you to use MLEPM with v5.51, and probably with 5.60+.

         [Warp comes with 5.51a, and you can also get it from, say,
         software.watson.ibm.com, in directory pub/os2/epm...

         EPM v6.00c is available from ftp.leo.org, in directory
         pub/comp/os/os2/editors/epm6beta.zip]

      o  Online help is included in MLEPM.INF.

      o  See MLEPM.ABS for a description of all included files.


Installation:
=============

      [See MLEPM.INF for more information.]

       1. Unpack this package.

       2. Unpack EX.551 or EX.600, depending of your EPM's version.

       2.bis Copy all .ex files somewhere along your EPMPATH.

       3. Put MPOPUP.EXE somewhere along your PATH.  Start MPOPUP.EXE
          (and put a Program Object refering to it in your startup
          folder)

       4. Load epm and edit the styles.smp file.  Customize the
          included styles (via the "Style" dialog, Ctrl+Y), if needed.

          [This step IS important!]

       5. Enable the profile support, if not already done:

          Bring up the "command" dialog (Ctrl+I), Enter the following
          command: PROFILE ON. Save your options (Options/Save
          options)

       6. Merge profile.smp with your profile.erx (if you were not
          using a profile.erx, just rename profile.smp to profile.erx,
          and put it somewhere along your EPMPATH).

       7. Exit EPM, and restart it.  Try loading a new C file, and
          play with it...

      That's all!


Common troubles:
================

      No popmenus
      No on-the-fly highlighting...

         Is MPOPUP.EXE running ?  If not, then start it!  (It's YOUR
         responsability to start MPOPUP, so, if you're using MLEPM,
         putting a shadow of MPOPUP.EXE in your startup folder is
         highly recommended.)

         [If MPOPUP.EXE is running, there should be a MLPOPUP entry
          in the task-list.]


Original FILE_ID.DIZ:
=====================

      MLEPM is a package for use with EPM, the
      OS/2 Enhanced Editor.  It works with both
      EPM v5.51a and v6.  It provides hooks, on-
      the-fly highlighting (with regular expr.),
      popup menus (for v5.51a) and editing modes
      for C/C++, REXX, E and some other languages.
      Source code, online documentation & compiled
      macros included.
